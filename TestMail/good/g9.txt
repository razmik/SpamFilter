Hey SLEF Team ,

It has been exactly one month since we got together to work on this exciting project which not only helps us to improve as an individual with better personality and good self-confidence,but also gives us this good feeling ,that we are contributing something back to the Sri Lankan community ,specifically to the Sri Lankan education system .

Here you can find the Project Report for the SLEF activities for the month of March ,2012 .This was sent to the Admin Board of SL2College. 

First check whether I have missed any important points .And then check for the tasks implemented by each one of you .See where we can improve our selves and lets try to target those ares . As a team lets try to improve the quantity and the quality of the tasks in the next month's report .

Thanks for all your contributions throughout the month of March. And it was great to see the commitment of some members who even participated in our meetings regardless of the exams /classes they had . Hats off to all of you . Special thanks goes to Sasanka for guiding us at all the time .

Lets keep a dream and work hard to achieve that !

Cheers
