Subject: Oct 1: Sasha Birthday Drinks at Lotus Club, NYC
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I'm coming back into NYC for a few days right around my 30th birthday  
and decided that I need to celebrate it in NYC.  So everyone should  
come out and help me.  Make it an ANO, make it a birthday, make it an  
excuse to invite someone out on a date.  I don't mind.  Either way, I  
will be at:

The Lotus Lounge
35 Clinton St
8 pm ->

Hope to see lots o peops.
