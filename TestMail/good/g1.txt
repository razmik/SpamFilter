Thanks!

We use Happ for almost everything.  Unfortunately, the analog  
joysticks (the ones in the review are digital) that they list are pot- 
driven, which is not ideal.  Pots wear out and are not terribly  
accurate.  An optical encoder would be far better.  They have one  
listed as optical, but since there are no datasheets, I can't figure  
out if they give full analog values.  And they seem to ignore their  
phone as a matter of course.
