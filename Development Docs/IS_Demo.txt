IS Demo Procedure

1. Implementation of the Bayesian Spam Filter

	1. Initializing the Spam Filter and the Knowledge Base
			Java SE 1.5
			Parameters in a app.config file - Threshold of the spamicity, # interesting words (max(|threshold-spamicity|))
	2. Train the knowledge Base with Training data
			Hash Table
			Training Data Sets(Legitimate and Spam)- each containing about 1000 mails
			Tokanization done with regular expression "\\w+" - alpha numeric words
			Algorithm will count each occurrence of a token - Good count is added by multiplying 2 to be safe from false positive
			Finalize by considering all tokens and calculate spamicity = in(spam) / ( in(spam) + in(legitimate) )
	3. Analyze the mail and check for spam
			Parsed into tokens
			Most interesting fifteen tokens are used to calculate the spamicity
			Using the threshold value, check if spam or not. As our testing, 0.85 would be the best threshold value.
	4. Update the knowledge base
			Use the tokens in the mail and update/train the knowledge base
	5. Store the mails in relevant Mail Boxes.
			If the mail is spam we store it in the spam folder and if it is a legitimate mail then we store it in the inbox.
	6. Can use the javadoc: file:///D:/Projects/Java/SpamFilter/dist/javadoc/index.html		
	
	
2. Checking for accuracy
			

3. Advantage
	Evolves with spams
	In normal filters: use “fashi0n” word instead of “fashion” but here it will be learnt. And have to change infranstructure every time.
	
4. Future Enhancements
		
	1. Preserving Case
			“free” and “Free” would be two - different spamicity values
			High Accuracy but high storage capacity of KB is needed
			
	2. Exclamation marks, periods and commas are constituent characters
	
	3. Context sensitive tokens
			Take 2 or 3 words together to calculate spamicity
			Relation based on adjecent words
	
	4. Differ tokens from To, From, Subject and Message body fields of the mail
	
	5. Sender himself can be taken as a factor of spamicity.
			Evaluate and give value to the sender. Once or twice or ... caught, then always a spammer.
